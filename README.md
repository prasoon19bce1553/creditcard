This case study requires to develop a customer segmentation to understand customer behaviour. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.
We defined features for the dataset and standardise the data so that all the features contribute equally to the result.
We build the cluster model and find the best number of clusters using elbow curve. From the elbow graph
plotted, we can observe that the “elbow” is the number 4 which is best or optimal for this case. Now we can
run a K-Means using as n-clusters the number 4 and get prediction for cluster number. 
 In the end, we visualise data based on clusters.
